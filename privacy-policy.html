Welcome to the Fahrraddiebstahlwarnung app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Robert Heimburger. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like
theme, etc.)) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the
app's data or uninstalling it.

The app is fully functional without the permission to use your location. If you chosse to grant the permission, you
location data will only be used while the app is open. Your location data will not be stored.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the
app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Robert Heimburger.
Berlin, Germany.
